Objective:
	I’m trying to break out of that catch-22 of needing experience to gain experience.  With ambitions to eventually end up in data sciences, I understand that the path entails a humble beginning and a ton of studying.  I seek long-term mentorship for my skill development in a setting where I am able to grow and meaningfully contribute back.

Why me?
	My previous career as a cook has planted me in fast-paced environments that necessitate adaptability; I am extremely comfortable wearing many hats and working with short and fluctuating deadlines.  My last few employers have placed me in management positions, and I relish in sharing  knowledge with my coworkers.  I would love to be a mentor in this field myself one day!
	I am a highly motivated lifelong learner who is reliable, curious, creative, and honest.  I am by no means adverse to hard work and am currently both working and studying full time.  Driven to expand my abilities, all my personal projects have stretched me beyond the skills acquired at school.  I love tackling large problems and see a personal lack of skills as an opportunity to grow.

Education and Skills:
	•	Associates Degree in Computer Science from University of the People.
	•	Red Seal certified Cook
	•	Comfortable working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, R, MySQL, Git, Shell scripting, CSM’s, Linux
	•	Super personable and happy working directly with clients.

Personal projects have included:
	•	Coding Tetris via TDD.
	•	A journaling app that I plan to add data mining to, in order to expose behavioral patterns.
	•	Creating and maintaining several servers, including the use of Google Cloud Platform.
	•	A travel calculator leveraging Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm to speed tax return calculations.
	•	A CLI for the Oxford Dictionary that will log queries and quiz users in an attempt to commit new vocabulary to memory.
